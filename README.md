# Car Telemetry

## Introduction

Car Telemetry is a fun project i thought when i was in the Aristotle Racing Team. Though i didn't have enough time to start it back then because there where other priorities,
now i found time and so i wanted to make it real.

## Usage

Car Telemetry aims at representing real time data of the Formula SAE car in the web. Here all visitors will be able to see the dynamic behavior of the car and some imformations
like if they where mechanics in the team!

## Data
* Steering Rotation
* Engine RPM
* Temperatures
* Suspension Dynamic Behaviour

## Make it Run

Get to folder with cmd and run
```cmd
  node app.js
```

Then got to localhost:3000
If you want to see random data, open new window and go to localhost:3000/testing

## Things to do:
* Add informations
* Add more Sensors Visualizations
* Optimize Layout
